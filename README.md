# concentricity

This is a simple watchface example that demonstrates how to build a watchface that is compatible with all Pebble
platforms (aplite, basalt, chalk). It makes use of new graphics APIs, including `graphics_fill_radial`, and 
`grect_inset`, as well as demonstrates how to use new defines like `PBL_RECT` and `PBL_ROUND`.

Hacked by keithzg to use a 24-hour base rather than a 12-hour base.
